Notes:

# Web Client

1. An alternate way to call the other micro service just like RestTemplate
2. Difference between the restTemplate and WebClient is that webclient can make
both sync & async calls but restTemplate can make only sync calls

# Plug-in
# org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webflux
- It allows reactive programming. It includes "WEB-CLIENT"

# compileOnly 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.18'
# annotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.18'
- It allows lombok programming. It prevents basic model creation

# org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client
- It registers the current application in eureka server for discovering services
- Application name needs to be mentioned in "application.properties" to reflect
in discovery server

# dependencyManagement {
	imports {
		mavenBom "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-dependencies:${springCloudVersion}"
	}
}
- Includes the cloud dependencies w.r.t spring cloud version compatible with java version
